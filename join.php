          <h2 >Officials</h2>
          <p>
          Officials play a vital role in the game, they are often described as the third team on the ice. The basic role of the on-ice officials can be broken down into two simple words â€“ safe and fair. For a referee to view and officiate the game with these two words in mind, they should be able to call a game that is acceptable to all of the participants.
          </p>   
        <h2>Juniors</h2>
        <p id="juniors">
        As part of this program we assign experienced officials as mentors to assist with the training and develop our younger officials. The on-ice mentorship and off-ice guidance brings practical and classroom style learning together with positive enforcement in order to build their self-confidence.
